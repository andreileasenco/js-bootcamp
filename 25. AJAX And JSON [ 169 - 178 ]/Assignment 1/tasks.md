## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- Create a **JSON** file containing a list of `5` **articles** named `articles.json`.
- Each **article** should include the `id`, `author's name`, `article category`, `article title`, and its `content`.
- You can name the elements as you prefer, following what you have learned before, and you can use any **random** **data**.

> - You can distinguish between each **JSON** object by using the comma "`,`" and placing them all inside square brackets "`[]`".
> - See the **example** below to understand the concept.
