## Tasks 🎯

- Create a new `Set` with the name `setOfNumbers`
- Add Number `10` to the  `Set` during creation
- Add Number `20` to `set` in a **separate line**
- In the same previous line, add a new element, which is the number of `Set` elements
- Print the `Set` in **Console** and make sure it is identical to the following example
- On only one separate line, use what I learned to print the **last element** in the `Set`


## Code 💻

```js
// Needed Output
Set(3) {10, 20, 2}
2
```
