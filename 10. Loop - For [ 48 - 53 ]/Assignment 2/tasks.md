## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- **Numbers** are **not** **allowed** at all, and you can use variable values along with what you have learned to accomplish the task.
- **Numbers** should be printed as shown in the example and **stop** at the number `3`.
- If the number is **less** than `10`, print a `0` before it
- `for` loop  should be used to do what is required

## Code ðŸ’»

```js
let start = 10;
let end = 0;
let stop = 3;

// Output
10
09
08
07
06
05
04
03
```
