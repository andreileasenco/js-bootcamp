## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- **Numbers** are **not** **allowed** at all, and you can use variable values along with what you have learned to accomplish the task.
- The **numbers** must be printed, **except** for the **number** `40` as shown in the example.
- `for` loop  should be used to do what is required

## Code ðŸ’»

```js
let start = 10;
let end = 100;
let exclude = 40;

// Output
10
20
30
50
60
70
80
90
100
```
