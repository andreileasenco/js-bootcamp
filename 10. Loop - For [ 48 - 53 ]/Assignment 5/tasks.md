## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- **Numbers** are **not** **allowed** at all, and you can use variable values along with what you have learned to accomplish the task.
- The **names** should be printed as shown in the example, with a **number** preceding each value **dynamically**.
- **Exclude** the names that start with the **letter** `A`.
- `for` loop  should be used to do what is required

## Code ðŸ’»

```js
let friends = ["Ahmed", "Sayed", "Eman", "Mahmoud", "Ameer", "Osama", "Sameh"];
let letter = "a";

// Output
"1 => Sayed"
"2 => Eman"
"3 => Mahmoud"
"4 => Osama"
"5 => Sameh"
```
