## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- **Numbers** are **not** **allowed** at all, and you can use variable values along with what you have learned to accomplish the task.
- The **numbers** from `2` to **the** **end** need to be printed.
- Think for a moment about how you can make the **loop** ignore the number `1` using logic.
- `for` Loop   should be used to do what is required
