## Tasks 🎯

- **numbers** are **forbidden** to be used permanently and you can use the values of variables with what you learned to implement the required
- You should **not** print **numbers** or **names** that **start** with the letter `A`
- `while` loop  should be used to do what is required

## Code 💻

```js
let friends = ["Ahmed", "Sayed", "Ali", 1, 2, "Mahmoud", "Amany"];
let index = 0;
let counter = 0;

// Output
"1 => Sayed"
"2 => Mahmoud"
```
