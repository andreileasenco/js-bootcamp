## Tasks 🎯

- You have a variable named `numsAndStrings` that contains **letters** and **numbers**.
  - Create a new **Array** using `filter()` + `map()`.
  - You should **exclude** the **letters** from the result.
  - You should **reverse** the **numbers**, meaning **positive** numbers become **negative** and **negative** numbers become **positive**.
  - You should use `map()` + `filter()` + whatever you want.

## Code 💻

```js
let numsAndStrings = [1, 10, -10, -20, 5, "A", 3, "B", "C"];

// [-1, -10, 10, 20, -5, -3]
```
