## Tasks 🎯

- You have a **variable** named `mix` that contains **letters** and **numbers**.
- Create a new array using `map()`
- You must exclude the **numbers** completely from the result
- You should **concatenate** the **letters** to achieve the desired outcome.
- Use `map()` + `reduce()`  with what you have learned to obtain the desired result.
- It is forbidden to use `join` or `filter()`


## Code 💻

```js
let mix = [1, 2, 3, "E", 4, "l", "z", "e", "r", 5, "o"];

// Elzero
```
