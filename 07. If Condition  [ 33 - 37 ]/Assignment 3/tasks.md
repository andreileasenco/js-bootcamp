## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- You have **three** **variables**, and the required task is to check the following conditions and display the message in the same Output format as shown in the example.
- All solutions must be implemented using a single `if` **condition**.
- **First line**: Ensure that the **third** **variable** is **greater** than the first and **not** **equal** to the second in terms of **type**.
- **Second** **line**: Ensure that the **third** **variable** is **greater** than the first, **equal** to the second in **value**, and **not** **equal** to the second in terms of **type**.
- **Third** **line**: Ensure that the value of the **third** **variable** is **not equal** to the first in terms of **value** and **type**, and **not** **equal** to the second in terms of **type**.
- You must check the data **type** and **value** yourself as the data type and value can change.

```js
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 30;
let num3 = "30";

// Needed Output
"30 Is Larger Than 10 And Type string Not The Same Type As number"
"30 Is Larger Than 10 And Value Is The Same As 30 And Type string Not The Same Type As number"
"{num3} Value And Type Is Not The Same As {num1} And Type Is Not The Same As {num2}"
```
