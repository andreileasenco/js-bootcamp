## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- You have **three variables** and the following **conditions** need to be checked  and the message should be displayed in the same output format as the example.
  - The **first line**, if the **value** of the first variable is the **same** as the **value** of the second variable
  - The **second line**, if the **value** of the first variable is the **same** as the **value** of the second variable, but the **type** is different
  - The **third line**, if the **value** of the first variable is **not** the **same** as the **value** of the third variable, and **not** also the same **type**
  - The **fourth line**, if the **value** of the second variable is **not equa**l to the third variable, but they are the of same **type**
  - You need to check the **data** **type** and **value** **yourself** because the data type and value **can change**.
