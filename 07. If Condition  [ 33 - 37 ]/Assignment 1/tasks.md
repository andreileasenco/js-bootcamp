## Tasks 🎯

- You have a **variable** that contains a number and it's required to **check** the **number** and do the necessary based on the **conditions**
- If the **number** is less than `10`, print the number and `00` before it like : `001` ... ``009``
- If the **number** is greater than `10` and smaller than `100`, print the number and `0` before it like : `011`  ...`099`
- If the **number** is greater than or equal to `100`, print the number as it is like : `101` ... `999`

```js
// Test Case 1
let num = 9; // "009"

// Test Case 2
