## Tasks 🎯

- Use the **variables** to come out with the result in the code
- The **variable** cannot be **repeated** more than once
- **No numbers** can be written by your hand and only use the values of **variables**

## Code 💻

```js
let a = 21;
let b = 20;

console.log("Write Your Code Here"); // _21_2021_2021_2021_20_
```
