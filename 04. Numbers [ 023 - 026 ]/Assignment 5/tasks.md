## Tasks 🎯

- The next **variable** contains the number `10`
  - You should use `isInteger` to come out with output number : `2`
  - It is **not allowed to write any numbers** yourself and you must use the previous feature to come out with the required output

## Code 💻

```js
let num = 10;

console.log(); // 2
```
