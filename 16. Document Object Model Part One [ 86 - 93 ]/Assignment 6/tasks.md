## Tasks ðŸŽ¯

- You have an **input** field that allows you to specify the **number** of elements you want to create.
- You have another **field** where you can **select** the **type** of element, either a `div` or `section`.
- You have an **input** field to enter the word that will appear inside each item.
- You have a **button** to initiate the creation process.
- When you click the **button** to create the elements, ensure that any previously created elements are first removed.
- If you wish, you can format the **CSS** using **JavaScript** to practice coordinating with JavaScript.
- Alternatively, you can naturally **style** the elements using **CSS** without any issues.
- Ensure that the **form** does not **submit** the data, preventing the page from **refreshing**.
- Each **element** should have an `id` and a `class`, with the `id` increasing for each element.
- Refer to the provided example for a better understanding.
