## Tasks 🎯

- You have multiple **arrays** containing the **names** of your friends.
- You can do whatever you want and use what you have learned to prepare the data for **destructuring**.
- Use **destructuring** assignment to get the desired result in the **console** in the end.
- **Only** **one destructuring** assignment should be made.



## Code 💻

```js
let arr1 = ["Ahmed", "Sameh", "Sayed"];
let arr2 = ["Mohamed", "Gamal", "Amir"];
let arr3 = ["Haytham", "Shady", "Mahmoud"];

// Play With Arrays To Prepare For Destructuring
// Write Your Destructuring Assignment Here

console.log(`My Best Friends: ${a}, ${b}, ${c}`);

// My Best Friends: Shady, Mahmoud, Ahmed
```
