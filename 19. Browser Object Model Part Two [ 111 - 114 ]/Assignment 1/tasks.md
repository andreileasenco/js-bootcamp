- Import **three fonts** from **Google Fonts** into the page: `Open Sans`, `Cairo`, and `Roboto`.
- Create three select boxes.
- The first **select box** should have **three options**: the names of the fonts that you imported (`Open`, `Cairo`, and `Roboto`).
- The second **select box** should have **six options**: any six **colors** that you choose.
- The third **select box** should have options for **font sizes** from `16` to `30`.
- The **default** value for each **select box** should be the **first option**.
- Each **default** value should be applied to the page using **CSS**.
- Now, allow the user to select from these options and apply them directly to the page when they select them.
- Save these selections to **local storage**.
- If the user **closes** the page or **reloads** it, the previously selected options should be applied, and the selections inside the **select boxes** should be **updated**.
